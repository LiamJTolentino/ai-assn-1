This is an implementation of a model-based agent that can recognize the pattern 1001 in a binary string.
The GUI wrapper simply uses Tkinter so the only library you'd need to install is numpy, but just in case, I did include the requirements.txt here.
The GUI is incredibly buggy but should work just fine as it's only needed to visually demonstrate how the agent works.
